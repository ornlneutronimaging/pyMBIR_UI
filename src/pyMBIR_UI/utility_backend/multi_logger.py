    This handler sends events to a queue. Typically, it would be used together
    with a multiprocessing Queue to centralise logging to file in one process
    (in a multi-process application), so as to avoid file write contention
    between processes.
    This code is new in Python 3.2, but this class can be copy pasted into
    user code for use with earlier Python versions.

# In practice, you would probably want to do this logic in the worker processes, to avoid
